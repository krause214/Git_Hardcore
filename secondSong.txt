[Verse 1: Toli Wild]
Riots on the street
Fire surrounds me
You can fuck your politics 'cause life ain't hit or miss
Я не способен её понять

[Chorus: Toli Wild]
I can't stop you now
I can't stop you now
I can't stop you now
You're already too far gone
You're already too far gone
You're already too far gone

[Post-Chorus: Aviel]
Anna, ayy

[Verse 2: Aviel]
This melody holds me
Your words apprehend me
'Cause you are the apocalypse, using bombs instead of kisses
You were always between the stars
So you can save your politics, life ain't hit or miss
君は遠ざかっていく

[Chorus: Aviel & Toli Wild]
I can't stop you now
I can't stop you now
I can't stop you now
You're already too far gone
You're already too far gone
You're already too far gone
You're already too far gonе
You're already too far gone
