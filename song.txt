[Verse 1]
Maybe I've been slipping back, heading south, carsick on a Tuesday
Missing cash, blacking out, heartless in a few ways
Shit for luck, elbows shredded, I held things steady like too late
Please calm the fuck down, I'll do whatever you say
I get it, I get it, I'm living too hard and it's time that I stop it
But rising on up and then tumbling down well it's part of the process
Bar tabs on a hot night in a cold basement
You say I'm crazy but I feel amazing

[Pre-Chorus]
My mother told me that the world has got its plans
I wanna hold em til they burn right through my hands
Don't ask me questions cause I'm tired of confessing
And I know that it's not much to say but I swear that I'd like to change

[Chorus]
I can't sleep, I hope I stay awake
Cause I've been running, running, running all day
Long nights, no peace, I feel like everybody's eyes on me
I can't sleep, I can't sleep
I can't sleep, I can't sleep
I can't sleep, I hope I stay awake
Cause I've been running, running, running all day
Long nights, no peace, I feel like everybody's eyes on me
I can't sleep, I can't sleep
I can't sleep, I can't sleep
